# Quote of the Week

> *relatively speaking*, my rust programs are like Leonardo DiCaprio in the Revenant, killing grizzly bears with their bare hands, dying and being frozen into a giant ice cubes then, surprise!, they're actually alive.
>
> they can handle a lot, they tend to experience far fewer bugs that come around days or weeks after going into production.
>
> my python programs, otoh, are like William Henry Harrison. Inauguration day! exciting! kind of chilly out here. uh oh -- pneumonia ... dang it!
